# Anthony's NixOS Adventure

This repository contains a series of lessons to help my friend Anthony get his
new NixOS system up and running.

## Current Setup

Anthony installed NixOS using the graphical installer and is currently running
the GNOME desktop environment. The initial NixOS configuration was generated by
the installer.

## Lessons

These lessons are driven by Anthony's questions as he explores NixOS.
